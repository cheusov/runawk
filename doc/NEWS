======================================================================
Version 1.6.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 26 Dec 2014 12:34:12 +0300

  Environment variable RUNAWK_KEEPTMP was introduced. If it set,
  temporary files are kept.  This is useful for debugging.

  io.awk:file_size was fixed (its behaviour depended on FS value)

  AWK_PROGS used for testing is now settable from environment.

  A few typos in runawk_modules.3 were fixed.
  Thanks to Andrew Shadura!

  Fix for bug in removing subdirs in temporary directory.

  Improvements and bug fix in runawk_modules.3

======================================================================
Version 1.4.3, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  9 Sep 2012 21:54:21 +0300

  runawk:
    - Clean-ups in usage message
    - system(3) is not used anymore for removing temporary directory
  modules:
    - Function print_help() has been moved
      from power_getopt.awk to init_getopt.awk

======================================================================
Version 1.4.2, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 19 Aug 2012 23:00:39 +0300

  runawk_modules.3 was added where all modules are documented

  Long options are considered deprecated

  -i and -I options were removed

  man pages are included to a distribution tarball,
  so pod2man is not needed for building

======================================================================
Version 1.4.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 22 Jul 2012 14:57:19 +0300

  Minor fixes in documentation

  Path to AWK interpreter is detected at build time (not hardcoded
  /usr/bin/awk).  This fixes runawk on, for example, Haiku.

  Clean-ups in build system. mk-configure-0.23.0 is required.

======================================================================
Version 1.4.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 27 Nov 2011 21:41:09 +0300

  exitnow.awk:
    - Fix: exitnow(status) finishes the execution of the script
      without running END sections even if status == 0.

  New module io.awk that includes the following functions:
  is_{file,dir,exec,socket,fifo,blockdev,chardev,symlink},
  file_size and file_type.

  tokenre.awk:
    - Function splitre0() was added that splits $0

  More regression tests were added.

======================================================================
Version 1.3.2, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  9 Oct 2011 14:11:32 +0300

  Internal arrays are relocated automatically.
  This fixes use of runawk(1) in combination with xargs(1), e.g.
  cat files.txt | xargs runawk -e '...'

======================================================================
Version 1.3.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri,  7 Jan 2011 16:45:30 +0200

  runawk.1 and alt_getopt.1 are included to tarball, so pod2man is not
  needed for installation.  No functional changes in source code.

======================================================================
Version 1.3.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue,  4 Jan 2011 20:14:04 +0200

  fix in runawk.c for warning message produced by Intel C compiler.

  fix for shquote("") from modules/shquote.awk.

  Source code is reorganized and it is easy to install examples,
  modules, alt_getopt, runawk executable and TODO/README/... files
  individually. See doc/INSTALL for details.

  mk-configure >= 0.21 is required

======================================================================
Version 1.2.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 23 Oct 2010 00:35:35 +0300

  Due to incompatibilities between traditional BSD mk files and mk
  files shipped with bmake by Simon J. Gerraty, I've decided to switch
  runawk from BSD mk files to mk-configure software build system. This
  makes Makefile significantly smaller, easier to understand and use
  and gives tons of new capabilities. Obviously this makes development
  even easier than before. Updated installation instruction is in
  README.

  New functions in heapsort.awk: "heapsort_fields" and "heapsort0" for
  sorting $1, $2 ...

  New function in tokenre.awk: "splitre".

  New samples of use (regression tests):
    examples/demo_tokenre4, demo_heapsort4.

======================================================================
Version 1.1.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed,  6 Oct 2010 22:51:56 +0300

  Makefile:
    - initialize {BIN,MAN}{OWN,GRP} to `id -{u,g}n`. You don't need
    to set these variables manually for unprivileged installation.

  Option -F is added to runawk. It passes field separator to AWK
  interpreter.

  New tool alt_getopt(1), an alternative to getopt(1) and POSIX
  shell's getopts.  alt_getopt is a command options parser that
  undestands long options.  It is implemented in runawk and uses its
  modules.  Also alt_getopt.sh shell include file is implemented and
  installed.  Examples: examples/demo_alt_getopt*.sh

  multisub.awk: ability to skip a matched text is added, see the
  documentation at the top of multisub.awk and examples/demo_multisub
  for the sample.  Function multisub now has optional third argument.

  New module glob.awk for working with glob patterns.
  See examples/demo_glob* for the samples.

  min.awk: new functions min3, min4, min5, min_key, min_value and
           key_of_min_value
  max.awk: new functions max3, max4, max5, max_key, max_value and
           key_of_max_value

  New module ord.awk from GNU awk.

  New module ftrans_in.awk from GNU awk (fixed and modified by me).
  Example: examples/demo_ftrans.

  New example: examples/demo_tokenre3. Thanks to Vlad Shakhov for the
  idea.

  New example: examples/demo_minmax.

======================================================================
Version 1.0.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  5 Sep 2010 16:39:47 +0300

  New functions for sorting indices in hash
     heapsort.awk:  heapsort_indices
     quicksort.awk: quicksort_indices
     sort.awk:      sort_indices

  New module ini.awk for reading .ini files.

======================================================================
Version 0.21.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 28 Mar 2010 13:43:48 +0300

  fixed: compilation failure on recent Linux-es (warn_unused_result
  attribute of system(3) function in recent glibc).

  fixed: compilation failures on FreeBSD ("assignment discards
  qualifiers from pointer target type" warning which is critical with
  -Werror).

  fixed: compilation failure with Intel C Compiler

  Now one can pass arguments to awk program specified with -e option after --,
  that is like the following
     runawk -e '<awk program>' -- <extra options for your program>

  New simple modules:

    - trim.awk: this modules provides a set of simple functions for
      trimming spaces from the string.

    - backslash_in.awk treats backslash symbol at the end of input line
      as "this line will continue on the next line".

	 $ cat ~/tmp/9.txt
	 Some text here \
	 and here too. \
	 This is still the first line.
	 This is the second.
	 And this is third one that\
	  continues on the next line \
	 and the next line too.
	 Ok, we finally have four lines of text.
	 $ runawk -f backslash_in.awk -e '{print}' ~/tmp/9.txt
	 Some text here and here too. This is still the first line.
	 This is the second.
	 And this is third one that continues on the next line and the next line too.
	 Ok, we finally have four lines of text.
	 $

    - trim_in.awk trims spaces from input lines.

    - CR_in.awk removes CR symbols from input lines.

======================================================================
Version 0.20.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu,  4 Mar 2010 18:33:03 +0200

  New module: fieldwidths.awk:
    By default AWK interpreter splits input lines into tokens
    according to regular expression that defines "spaces" between them
    using special variable FS. Sometimes it is useful to define a
    fixed-size fields for tokens. This is what this module is for. The
    functionality of fieldwidths.awk is very close to GNU awk's
    FIELDWIDTHS variable but is available for all flavours of AWK ;-)

  New module: tmpfile.awk:
    This module provides a function `tmpfile' for generating temporary
    filenames. All these filenames are under temporary directory
    created (if necessary) by runawk(1) which is removed automatically
    during normal exit or when runawk(1) reveives SIGINT, SIGQUIT,
    SIGTERM, SIGHUP or SIGPIPE. Thus, this module provides a safe way
    to work with temporary files.

  new runawk directive: #interp-var that specifies an environment
  variable name that keeps a preferred AWK interpreter. See a manual
  page for details.

  new runawk directive: #safe-use that #use module if it
  exists. Example is below. For more details see a manual page.

    foobar application:
      #!/usr/bin/env runawk
      #safe-use "~/.foobarrc" "/etc/foobar.conf"
      BEGIN {
        print foo, bar, baz
      }

    config file ~/.foobarrc for foobar application:
      BEGIN {
        foo = "foo10"
        bar = "bar20"
        baz = 123
      }

  fix in power_getopt.awk: arguments equal to "" (empty string) are
  now processed correctly.

  power_getopt.awk: after options processing ARGV [1], ARGV [2], ...,
  ARGV [ARGC-1] are set to non-option arguments.

  new in heapsort.awk: functions sift_down and sift_up.

  fix in tokenre.awk: There is no need to initialize TRE variable, it
  is already initialized to "" at startup. This fixes a problem with
  'runawk -v TRE=lalala ...'

  Minor fixes and rewords in the runawk.1 and README.

======================================================================
Version 0.19.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  3 Jan 2010 15:23:31 +0200

  fix in runawk.c: \n was missed in "running '%s' failed: %s" error
  message.  The problem was seen on ancient (12 years old) HP-UX

  fix in teets/test.mk: "diff -u" is not portable (SunOS, HP-UX),
  DIFF_PROG variable is introduced to fix the problem

  fix in modules/power_getopt.awk: after printing help message we
  should exit immediately not running END section, s/exit/exitnow/

  new function heapsort_values in heapsort.awk module

  new function quicksort_values in quicksort.awk module

  new function sort_values in sort.awk module

======================================================================
Version 0.18.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat,  7 Nov 2009 17:08:16 +0200

 Makefile:
    !!! "install-dirs" target has been renamed to "installdirs" !!!

    - At compile time MODULESDIR can contain a *list* of
      colon-separated directories,
      e.g. /usr/local/share/runawk:/usr/local/share/awk

 - power_getopt.awk, alt_getopt.awk and init_getopt.awk:
    - Support for multiply applied options, e.g. -vvv for increasing
      verbosity level. If option without arguments is multiply
      applied, getarg() function returns a number of times it was
      applied, not just 0 or 1.

 New modules:

    - init_getopt.awk using alt_getopt.awk and used by power_getopt.awk.
      Its goal is to initialize `long_opts' and `long_opts' variables
      but not run `getopt' function.

    - heapsort.awk  -  heapsort :-)
    - quicksort.awk - quicksort :-)
    - sort.awk      - either heapsort or quicksort,
                      the default is heapsort.
      Unfortunately GAWK's asort() and asorti() functions
      do *not* satisfy my needs. Another (and more important) reason
      is a portability.

 Improvements, clean-ups and fixes in regression tests.

 runawk-0-18-0 was successfully tested on the following platforms:
    NetBSD-5.0/x86, NetBSD-2.0/alpha, OpenBSD-4.5/x86,
    FreeBSD-7.1/x86, FreeBSD-7.1/spark, Linux/x86 and
    Darwin/ppc.

======================================================================
Version 0.17.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 12 Sep 2009 01:29:31 +0300

 runawk:
    - ADDED: new option for runawk for #use'ing modules: -f.
      runawk can also be used for oneliners! ;-)

      runawk -f abs.awk -e 'BEGIN {print abs(-123); exit}'

    - In a multilined code passed to runawk using option -e, spaces
      are allowed before #directives.

    - After inventing alt_getopt.awk module there is no reason for
      heuristics that detects whether to add `-' to AWK arguments or
      not. So I've removed this heuristics. Use alt_getopt.awk module
      or other "smart" module for handling options correctly!

 alt_getopt.awk and power_getopt.awk:
    - FIX: for "abc:" short options specifier BSD and GNU getopt(3)
      accept "-acb" and understand it as "-a -cb", they also accept
      "-ac b" and also translate it to "-a -cb". Now alt_getopt.awk
      and power_getopt.awk work the same way.

 power_getopt.awk:
    - -h option doesn't print usage information, --help (and its short
      synonym) does.

 New modules:
    - shquote.awk, implementing shquote() function.
	shquote(str):
            `shquote' transforms the string `str' by adding shell
            escape and quoting characters to include it to the
            system() and popen() functions as an argument, so that
            the arguments will have the correct values after being
            evaluated by the shell.
        Inspired by NetBSD's shquote(3) from libc.

    - runcmd.awk, implementing functions runcmd1() and xruncmd1()
        runcmd1(CMD, OPTS, FILE):
            wrapper for function system() that runs a command CMD
            with options OPTS and one filename FILE.  Unlike
            system(CMD " " OPTS " " FILE) the function runcmd1()
            handles correctly FILE and CMD containing spaces, single
            quote, double quote, tilde etc.

        xruncmd1(FILE):
            safe wrapper for 'runcmd(1)'.
            awk exits with error if running command failed.

    - isnum.awk, implementing trivial isnum() function,
            see the source code.

    - alt_join.awk, implementing the following functions:
        join_keys(HASH, SEP):
            returns string consisting of all keys from HASH separated
            by SEP.

        join_values(HASH, SEP):
            returns string consisting of all values from HASH separated
            by SEP.

        join_by_numkeys (ARRAY, SEP [, START [, END]]):
            returns string consisting of all values from ARRAY
            separated by SEP. Indices from START (default: 1) to END
            (default: +inf) are analysed. Collecting values is stopped
            on index absent in ARRAY.

======================================================================
Version 0.16.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  5 Apr 2009 12:45:44 +0300

  Lots of demo programs for most runawk modules were created and 
  they are in examples/ subdirectory now.

  New MEGA module ;-) power_getopt.awk
  See the documentation and demo program examples/demo_power_getopt.
  It makes options handling REALLY easy.

  New modules:
      embed_str.awk
      has_suffix.awk
      has_prefix.awk
      readfile.awk
      modinfo.awk

  Minor fixes and improvements in dirname.awk and basename.awk.
  Now they are fully compatible with dirname(1) and basename(1)

  RUNAWK sets the following environment variables for the child awk
      subprocess:

      RUNAWK_MODC - A number of modules (-f filename) passed to AWK
      RUNAWK_MODV_<n> - Full path to the module #n,
          where n is in [0..RUNAWK_MODC) range.

  RUNAWK sets RUNAWK_ART_STDIN environment variable for the child awk
  subprocess to 1 if additional/artificial `-' was added to the list
  to awk's arguments.

  Makefile:
     bmake-ism were removed. Now Makefile is fully compatible with
     FreeBSD make.

     CLEANFILES target is used instead of hand-made rules

     Minor fix in 'test_all' target

======================================================================
Version 0.15.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 19 Dec 2008 21:41:00 +0200

   new module alt_getopt.awk that implements 'getopt' function
   compatible with "Utility Syntax Guidelines" described in
   "Single UNIX Specification"
       http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap12.html#tag_12_02
   "getopt" function from this module is similar to C function getopt(3)
   (Idiotic GNU getopt(3) must die!)

   Better heuristics for adding `-' to the list awk's arguments,
   now it better conforms to "Utility Syntax Guidelines".

   Makefile: STDIN_FILENAME defaults to `-', not `/dev/stdin'
   Interix has no /dev/stdin file

   Makefile: WARNS=4 ====> WARNS?= 4
   Makefile: CPPFLAGS -> CFLAGS, FreeBSD make mk scripts
       don't support CPPFLAGS

   Lots of regression tests for 'getopt' function

======================================================================
Version 0.14.3, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 18 Oct 2008 19:39:47 +0300

   The following code no longer fails with NAWK under NetBSD
          runawk -e ' { print "123" } ' /dev/null

   fixed: compilation bug under FreeBSD (WARNS=4 -> warning -> error)
   caused by comparison of signed and unsigned values

   More verbose output when stat(filename) failed

   modules/str2regexp.awk: adapted to buggy MAWK

======================================================================
Version 0.14.2, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 29 Aug 2008 17:28:34 +0300

   Temporary file is removed if runawk is killed by
   SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP or SIGPIPE signals.
   (Temporary file is created by 'runawk -e ...')

======================================================================
Version 0.14.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 19 Jul 2008 22:53:45 +0300

    FIXED: The following code doesn't work with runawk-0.14.0
        runawk -e '
        #use "anymodule.awk"

        <ANY_CODE_HERE>
        '

        This code requires a creation of the temporary file that was
        removed in runawk-0.14.0. Now temporary file is created using
        mkstemp(3).

        Regression tests are created for testing.

======================================================================
Version 0.14.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 12 Jul 2008 17:29:22 +0300

    Temporary file is not needed anymore for -e option.

    FIXED: #env didn't work under Linux/glibc.

    FIXED: compilation error under FreeBSD.

    Lots of new regression tests. Code clean-ups.
    fgetln is not required anymore. No hacks about it.

    If error happens while processing a #directive,
    a correct line number is output

======================================================================
Version 0.13.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 15 Jun 2008 11:30:06 +0300

    ADDED: option -v|--assign that works like AWK's -v option.
    This is to pass some variables to AWK interpreter.
    Example: runawk -v var=123 -e 'BEGIN {print var }'

    modules/xgetline.awk: better error message/clean-ups

    modules/abort.awk: NR is also printed to stderr

    minor fixes in *.c

    clean-ups and fixes in 'make test'. Now it doesn't depend on my
    own system and runawk directory

    'make test' exits with non-zero exit status if regression tests
    fail

    Makefile: ported to ancient pmake-1.45 found in some Linux distros

======================================================================
Version 0.12.a, by Aleksey Cheusov, Mon,  Tue,  4 Mar

    fix in alt_assert.awk

======================================================================
Version 0.12.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Mon,  3 Mar 2008 23:04:10 +0200

    new directive '#env' is implemented.
    It sets environment for running awk subprocess using setenv(3)

          Example:

             #!/usr/local/bin/runawk

             #env "LC_ALL=C"

             $1 ~ /^[A-Z]+$/ { # A-Z is valid if LC_CTYPE=C
                 print $1
             }

    New modules

      match_br.awk

	 match_br(STRING, BR_OPEN, BR_CLOSE)
	 return start position (or zero if failure) of the substring
	 surrounded by balanced (), [], {} or similar characters
	 Also sets RSTART and RLENGTH variables just like
	 the standard 'match' function does

	 For example:
	 print match_br("A (B (), C(D,C,F (), 123))", "(", ")")
	 print RSTART, RLENGTH
	 -| 3
	 -| 3
	 -| 24

      braceexpand.awk

         braceexp(STRING)
           implement shell-like brace expansion

         For example:
             print braceexpand("ab{,22{,7,8}}z{8,9}")
             -| abz8 abz9 ab22z8 ab22z9 ab227z8 ab227z9 ab228z8 ab228z9

      exitnow.awk

         see the code. exitnow.awk is used by alt_assert.awk and
         abort.awk

      abort.awk

         abort(MSG, EXIT_STATUS) -- print MSG to stderr and exits
         program with EXIT_STATUS.  if EXIT_STATUS is zero of is not
         specified, 1 is assigned.

      dirname.awk

         similar to UNIX's dirname(1)

      basename.awk

         similar to UNIX's basename(1)

      xgetline.awk

         xgetline0([FILE])

           Safe analog to 'getline < FILE' or 'getline' (if no FILE
           is specified).  0 at the end means that input line is
           assigned to $0.

         xgetline([FILE])
           Safe analog to 'getline __input < FILE' and 'getline __input'
           (if no FILE is specified)

         In both cases "safe" means that returned value is analysed
         and if it is less than zero (file reading error happens)
         program will be terminated emmidiately with appropriate error
         message printed to stderr.  Both functions return zero if end
         of file is reached or non-zero if reading was sucessfull.

         Example:
         while (xgetline("/etc/passwd")){
             print "user: " __input
         }

      xclose.awk
      xsystem.awk -- safe wrappers over 'close' and 'system' functions

======================================================================
Version 0.11.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat,  9 Feb 2008 17:35:59 +0200

    New modules

      tokenre.awk:

         By default AWK splits input strings into tokens according to regular
         expression that defines "space" between tokens using special
         variable FS. In many situations it is more useful to define regular
         expressions for tokens themselves. This is what this module does.

         tokenre(STRING, REGEXP)
         `tokenre' extracts substrings from STRING
         according to REGEXP from the left to the right and assigns $1, $2
         etc. and NF variable.

         tokenre0(REGEXP)
         Does the the same as `tokenre' but splits $0 instead

         TRE - variable. If it is set to not empty string, splitting is
         made by default for all input strings.

         For example:
         tokenre("print \"Hello world!\"", "\"([^\"]|\\\")*\"|[[:alnum:]_]+")
         | NF == 2
         | $1 == print
         | $2 == "Hello world!"

      str2regexp.awk

         str2regex(STRING)
         returns a regular expression that matches given STRING

         For example:
         print str2regexp("all special symbols: ^$(){}[].*+?|\\")
         -| all special symbols: [^][$][(][)][{][}][[]\][.][*][+][?][|]\\

      multisub.awk

         multisub(STRING, SUBST_REPLS)
         `multisub' is a substitution function. It searches for
         a list of substrings, specified in SUBST_REPL
         in a left-most longest order and (if found) replaces
         found fragments with appropriate replacement.
         SUBST_REPL format: "SUBSTRING1:REPLACEMENT1   SUBSTRING2:REPLACEMENT2...".
         Three spaces separate substring:replacement pairs from each other.

         For example:
         print multisub("ABBABBBBBBAAB", "ABB:c   BBA:d   AB:e")
         |- ccBBde

    new target 'test_all' runs tests for all available
    awk interpreters

Version 0.10.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri,  1 Feb 2008 21:25:48 +0200

    FIXED: If AWK interpreter segfaults or killed by any other signal,
    runawk exits with exit status 0.  Affected runawk versions: all.
    Now this is fixed and runawk exits with exit status 128+SIGNAL
    just like many shells.

    EXIT STATUS section has been added to the manual page.

======================================================================
Version 0.10.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed, 23 Jan 2008 00:38:31 +0200

    ADDED: The environment variable RUNAWK_AWKPROG overrides
    the default awk interpreter which is set at compile time.
    Documentation updated accordingly.

    FIXED: unsafe use of strdup(3)

    I've copied MIT License text to code from www.opensource.org.
    Do you see any difference?

    ADDED: new trivial module pow.awk that implements function "pow"

    fix: MKMAN and MKCATPAGES make's standard variables are checked
    during installation

    In order to build runawk not in a directory you can either build
    it like this (standard way)
        cd /src/dir; make all install MAKEOBJDIR=/obj/dir
    or like this
        cd /obj/dir; make -f /src/dir/Makefile all install

    optional config.h is #included if you need it

    other minor fixes and improvements both in code and documentation

======================================================================
Version 0.9.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 23 Dec 2007 22:20:23 +0200

    I switched to BSD make. I really hate automake and its approach in
    general. I'm not expert in BSD, but their 'make' looks much
    better. But using it makes some changes in building process, see
    README/INSTALLATION section for a brief description.

    ADDED: man page for runawk. HTML version runawk.html can also be
    generated from runawk.pod using pod2html, see Makefile.

    ADDED: -i/-I options for forcing/disabling adding /dev/stdin to
    the list of awk arguments. See man page for more information.

    A few AWK modules are installed to PREFIX/share/runawk: abs.awk,
    min.awk, max.awk and alt_assert.awk. This directory is also checked
    while searching for modules. See man page for more details.

    AWK_PROG and STDIN_FILENAME Makefile variables can be passed to make
    program to change a path to an actual AWK interpreter (/usr/bin/awk
    by default) and stdin file (/dev/stdin by default).

    Lots of improvements in documentation

    ADDED: regression tests. Run them by running 'make test' and let
    me know if somethiung fails.

    debugging output is sent stdout, not stderr

    ADDED: long synonyms for short options, --help, --version etc.

    clean-ups in Makefile

    options handling improvements

======================================================================
Version 0.8.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed, 24 Oct 2007 14:46:12 +0300

    FIXED: default stdin file should be /std/stdin, not /dev/stderr,
    I've made a typo.

======================================================================
Version 0.8.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 21 Oct 2007 17:19:46 +0300

    FIXED: return code of execvp is not analysed, i.e. when running
    an interpreter fails, runawk silently exits with zero exit status.
    Now it fails with exit status 1 and print an error to stderr.

    stdin filename defaults to "/dev/stdin"

    ROOT variable in Makefile has been renamed
    to more commonly used PREFIX

    realloc(2) is not used anymore. arrays[ARRAY_SZ] are used now.

    AWK and STDIN_FILENAME variables are removed from Makefile.
    Use CPPFLAGS for changing defaults.

======================================================================
Version 0.7.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 22 Sep 2007 02:30:26 +0300

    First publicly available release.

    See README for a documentation
