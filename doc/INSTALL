                             INSTALLATION

*
   Maybe runawk is already packaged for your platform. See PACKAGES
   section below and your system's packages management tools.

*
   We need bmake (portable version of NetBSD make) for building runawk.
   I'd recommend to use latest stable version of bmake.

   http://crufty.net/help/sjg/bmake.html
   http://freshmeat.net/projects/bmake/

              <<<***!!! GNU make IS NOT GOOD !!!***>>>

*
   We also need mk-configure >= 0.39.0.

   https://github.com/cheusov/runawk

* Uncompress tarball you've downloaded like this
   gzip -dc runawk-X-Y-Z.tar.gz | tar -xf-

* cd runawk-X.Y.Z

* mkcmake help

* mkcmake

* mkcmake test
   If this step fails on your system, PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

* mkcmake install

There is a lot of Makefile variables that can be changed during
build and installation.

  MODULESDIR     - directory where modules are installed to [${PREFIX}/share/runawk]
  AWK_PROG       - path to the default AWK interpreter
  STDIN_FILENAME - path to stdin device file                [-]

  PREFIX         - where runawk(1) is installed to
  MANDIR         - root directory for manual pages
  DESTDIR        - fake root for installation
  CPPFLAGS
  CFLAGS
  LDFLAGS
  LDADD
  ...

  See mk-configure(7) for details.

* RunAWK distribution consists of the following subprojects:
   - runawk   -- runawk executable
   - modules  -- modules written in .awk
   - doc      -- README, COPYRIGHT, NEW, TODO files
   - examples -- samples of use for runawk and its modules
   - a_getopt -- alt_getopt(1) and alt_getopt.sh

  By default only "runawk", "modules" and "a_getopt" are built and installed.
  However you can easily build and install any subproject like the following

    mkcmake all-examples install-examples
    mkcmake all-doc install-doc
    etc.

  See mk-configure(7) and ./Makefile for details.

  You can also set subprojects you need in SUBPRJ_DFLT variable.

    export SUBPRJ_DFLT='runawk modules examples a_getopt doc'
    mkcmake all install

*  Non-standard variable you may want to change.
   EGDIR - directiory where examples/ will be installed to
           ($PREFIX/share/doc/runawk/examples)
   MODULESDIR - directory where modules/ will be installed to
           ($PREFIX/share/runawk)
   DOCDIR - directory where doc/ will be installed to
           ($PREFIX/share/doc/runawk)
   AWK_PROG       - path to the default AWK interpreter
           (/usr/bin/awk)
   STDIN_FILENAME - path to stdin device file
           (-)

Examples of building and installing:

   0)
     mkcmake all install

   1)
     export PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc; \
            mkcmake all install DESTDIR=/tmp/fakeroot

   2)

   3)
     env CC='icc -no-gcc' \
       PREFIX=/home/cheusov/local \
