                             INSTALLATION

0)
   Maybe runawk is already packaged for your platform. See PACKAGES
   section below and your system's packages management tools.

1)
   We need bmake (portable version of NetBSD make) for building runawk.
   I'd recommend to use latest stable version of bmake.

   http://crufty.net/help/sjg/bmake.html
   http://freshmeat.net/projects/bmake/

              <<<***!!! GNU make IS NOT GOOD !!!***>>>

2)
   We also need mk-configure >= 0.20.0.

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/mk-configure/

3) Uncompress tarball you've downloaded like this
   gzip -dc runawk-X-Y-Z.tar.gz | tar -xf-

2) cd runawk-X.Y.Z

3) mkcmake

4) mkcmake test
   If this step fails on your system, PLEASE LET ME NOW.

5) mkcmake install

There is a lot of Makefile variables that can be changed during
build and installation.

  MODULESDIR     - directory where modules are installed to [${PREFIX}/share/runawk]
  AWK_PROG       - path to the default AWK interpreter
  STDIN_FILENAME - path to stdin device file                [-]

  PREFIX         - where runawk(1) is installed to
  MANDIR         - root directory for manual pages
  DESTDIR        - fake root for installation
  CPPFLAGS
  CFLAGS
  LDFLAGS
  LDADD
  ...

  See mk-configure(7) for details.

6) RunAWK distribution consists of the following subprojects:
   - runawk   -- runawk executable
   - modules  -- modules written in .awk
   - doc      -- README, COPYRIGHT, NEW, TODO files
   - examples -- samples of use for runawk and its modules
   - a_getopt -- alt_getopt(1) and alt_getopt.sh

  By default only "runawk", "modules" and "a_getopt" are built and installed.
  However you can easily build and install any subproject like the following

    mkcmake all-examples install-examples
    mkcmake all-doc install-doc
    etc.

  See mk-configure(7) and ./Makefile for details.

  You can also set subprojects you need in SUBPRJ_DFLT variable.

    export SUBPRJ_DFLT='runawk modules examples a_getopt doc'
    mkcmake all install

7) Non-standard variable you may want to change.
   EGDIR - directiory where examples will be installed to
           ($PREFIX/share/doc/runawk/examples)
   MODULESDIR - directory where modules will be installed to
           ($PREFIX/share/runawk)
   DOCDIR - directory where doc/ will be installed to
           ($PREFIX/share/doc/runawk)

------------------------------
Examples of building and installing:

   0)
     mkcmake all install

   1)
     export PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc; \
            mkcmake all install DESTDIR=/tmp/fakeroot

   2)
     env CC='icc -no-gcc' \
       PREFIX=/home/cheusov/local \
       CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/pkg/include \
       LDFLAGS='-L/usr/pkg/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/pkg/lib' \
       LDADD=-lextralib \
       CFLAGS='-O2 -fomit-frame-pointers' \
          mkcmake -s all install
