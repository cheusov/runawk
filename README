                             INSTALLATION

0)
   Maybe runawk is already packaged for your platform. See PACKAGES
   section below and your system's packages management tools.

1)
   We need bmake (portable version of NetBSD make) for building runawk.
   I'd recommend to use latest stable version of bmake.

   http://crufty.net/help/sjg/bmake.html
   http://freshmeat.net/projects/bmake/

              <<<***!!! GNU make IS NOT GOOD !!!***>>>

2)
   We also need mk-configure >= 0.20.0.

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/mk-configure/

3) Uncompress tarball you've downloaded like this
   gzip -dc runawk-X-Y-Z.tar.gz | tar -xf-

2) cd runawk-X.Y.Z

3) mkcmake

4) mkcmake test
   If this step fails on your system, PLEASE LET ME NOW.

5) mkcmake install

There is a lot of Makefile variables that can be changed during
build and installation.

  MODULESDIR     - directory where modules are installed to [${PREFIX}/share/runawk]
  AWK_PROG       - path to the default AWK interpreter
  STDIN_FILENAME - path to stdin device file                [-]

  PREFIX         - where runawk(1) is installed to
  MANDIR         - root directory for manual pages
  DESTDIR        - fake root for installation
  CPPFLAGS
  CFLAGS
  LDFLAGS
  LDADD
  ...

  See mk-configure(7) for details.

------------------------------
Examples of building and installing:

   0)
     mkcmake all install

   1)
     export PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc; \
            mkcmake all install DESTDIR=/tmp/fakeroot

   2)
     env CC='icc -no-gcc' \
       PREFIX=/home/cheusov/local \
       CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/pkg/include \
       LDFLAGS='-L/usr/pkg/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/pkg/lib' \
       LDADD=-lextralib \
       CFLAGS='-O2 -fomit-frame-pointers' \
          mkcmake -s all install

                           MODULES

RunAWK provides lots of AWK modules ready for use. All of them are
under modules/ subdirectory. They are installed by default.

    abort.awk,  alt_assert.awk
                     - power abort() and assert()
    alt_join.awk     - join :-)
    braceexpand.awk  - awk equivalent to shell's braceexpand functionality
    basename.awk, dirname.awk
                     - equivalents to basename(1) and dirname(1)
    embed_str.awk    - reads strings from AWK code
    exitnow.awk      -
    has_prefix.awk, has_suffix.awk
                     - trivial string functions
    match_br.awk     - find pair closed brackets in a string
    max.awk, min.awk, isnum.awk, abs.awk
                     - trivial math functions
    modinfo.awk      - routines to get an information about modules that
                       are in use
    multisub.awk     - another replacement functions
    pow.awk          - synonym for ^
    init_getopt.awk, alt_getopt.awk, power_getopt.awk
                     - POSIX/SUS compatible routines
                       for handling options EASILY ;-)
    readfile.awk     - read an entire file into variable
    runcmd.awk       - safe wrapper over system()
    shquote.awk      - escapes shell's special characters
    heapsort.awk, quicksort.awk, sort.awk
                     - sorting functions
    str2regexp.awk   - string to regexp routines
    tokenre.awk      - alternative mechanism for separating input into tokens
    xclose.awk, xgetline.awk, xsystem.awk
                     - functions to write robust programs
    tmpfile.awk      - generates names of automatically deleted tempfiles
    fieldwidths.awk  - portable equivalent of GNU awk's FIELDWIDTHS ;-)
    CR_in.awk        - removes CR symbols from input lines.
    trim.awk         - functions for trimming spaces from the string.
    trim_in.awk      - trims spaces from input lines.
    backslash_in.awk - treats backslash symbol at the end of line as
                       "this line will continue on the next one".
    ini.awk          - functions for reading Win .ini files.
    ftrans_in.awk    - handle data file transitions
    ord.awk          - character to id and id to character convertors

======================================================================

                           SCRIPTS

RunAWK also provides a few scripts:

   alt_getopt     - program arguments parser aware of long options,
                    alternative to POSIX getopts and getopt(1).
                    In addition to alt_getopt(1) utility alt_getopt.sh
                    shell library is also provided that provides
                    an alternative way for handling options.
   alt_getopt.sh  - shell library functionally equivalent
                    to alt_getopt(1)
