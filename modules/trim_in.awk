# =head2 trim_in.awk
#
# As the name of this module says (_in suffix) this module reads and
# potentially changes input lines.
#
# Leading, ending spaces and/or spaces in the middle of input lines
# are removed depending on TRIM variable.
# TRIM values:
#   "l" - remove leading space characters
#   "r" - remove ending space characters
#   "c" - remove extra space characters in the middle of input lines
#   "lr" - See l and r
#   "lrc" - See l, r and c
#   "lc" - See l and c
#   "cr" - See c and r
# By default TRIM variable is set to "lr". TRIM set to a single space
# character means no trimming.
#

BEGIN {
	if (TRIM == ""){
		TRIM = "lr"
