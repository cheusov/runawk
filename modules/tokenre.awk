# =head2 tokenre.awk
#
# By default AWK splits input lines into tokens according to regular
# expression that defines "spaces" between tokens using special
# variable FS. In many situations it is more useful to define regular
# expressions for tokens themselves. This is what this module does.
#
# =over 2
#
# =item I<tokenre(STRING, REGEXP)>
#
# extracts substrings from STRING
# according to REGEXP from the left to the right and assigns $1, $2
# etc. and NF variable.
#
# =item I<tokenre0(REGEXP)>
#
# Does the the same as `tokenre' but splits $0 instead.
#
# =item I<splitre(STRING, ARR, REGEXP)>
#
# The same as `tokenre' but ARR[1], ARR[2]... are assigned.
# A number of extracted tokens is a return value.
#
# =item I<TRE>
#
# global variable. If it is set to non-empty string, all input
# lines are split automatically.
#
# =back
#

# See example/demo_tokenre for the sample of usage
